# embik/weather-api

A small "personal research" project to build an API for returning weather data. The goal is to have (potentially) swapable data and caching backends.

## Caching

To improve return times, the API is using a caching component. No component has been chosen yet.

## Data Backend(s)

The main data backend is using [open data provided by DWD (German Meteorological Service)](https://opendata.dwd.de/).
